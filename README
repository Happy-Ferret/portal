# Welcome to The portal

`The portal` is an experimental project aiming to provide a very simple and hackable portal. 
This project can be used as a technical foundation for any application with mashup needs. 
The purpose of `The Portal` is to avoid usage of Java portals based on Portlet specifications that reveal themselves almost always heavy and cumbersome.

Technically, `The Portal` rely on [Play Framework 2](https://www.playframework.com/), [Akka](http://akka.io/), [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for the basic portal features. But it doesn't mean that you'll have to write Scala code ;-).

`Mashetes` are supposed to be JavaScript only applications consuming internal APIs and external REST services using a very powerful HTTP client library. These applications are written using [Facebook React library](http://facebook.github.io/react/). `Mashetes` can communicate with each other and can be contacted from outside throught an `Event Bus` allowing server side push, unicasting, broadcasting, filtering, etc ... You can also keep it simple by only integrating iframes (it seems that this is a common use case). In that case, `The portal` provide a very simple SSO mechanisme to propage user identity to the external resources.

Code of `The Portal` is available at : [https://github.com/mathieuancelin/portal](https://github.com/mathieuancelin/portal/)

A demo instance is available on [Heroku](http://theportal.herokuapp.com)
